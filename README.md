**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
  The easiest way to interpret user needs and be able to implement them into a program is simply by asking the potential user groups.  From there we can create user stories and focus on what they are looking for and create a bigger idea of how to get the desired functions for them.  User stories provide an extremely helpful tool to reference back to frequently to make sure the project is on the right track and following what the end users are expecting and desiring.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  I approach program development the same way I do most every project, the metaphorical grabbing the bull by the horns and wrestling with it until it's complete.  I would like to setup personal sprint goals in the future for myself, some of the projects I've tackled have been a larger headache for no reason than I would've liked and could easily have been broken down using Agile practices.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  Being a good team member means admitting when you don't know the answer and asking for help when it's needed, trying to tackle everything by yourself and not working together leads to errors and internal fighting that's not necessary or productive.
